- How to represent the time of the spiketrains
  In relative or absolute times, or in timesteps (determined by delta_t)

- Connected neurons could be simply determined by the weight matrix.
  Neurons with weight 0 are not connected, else they are connected

- I guess weights are not symmetric.
  So neuron w(AB) != w(BA)

- There is the need for some initial spiketrains in some neurons.
  Or else no neuron would ever fire.
  How is this handled in nature? Are there some 'random shooting' neurons?

- What value should the kernel return in case of a spike?
  Idea: a tuple (True, 0) iff spike, (False, value) else.

- How does the postsynaptic current epsilon look like?

- In guide.pdf to which neuron does the current belong to?
  I think it is neuron i, so maybe call it epsilon_i?

- We did not model the delay in the membrane yet?

- I think a continuous, timestep like, simulation might be quite handy.
  Because a spike of neuron i at time t, is based on (potentially) all spikes of
  a connected neuron j previous to time t. Those spikes might be again
  based on spikes of neuron i. This dependence issue could be solved with timestep simulation.

- I put 'potentially' in parentheses, because

- Was ist schneller Faltung oder DGL, bei Epsilon?
